SOLUTION 1) FOR ODD ENTRIES

SELECT ROUND(LAT_N,4) FROM
(SELECT LAT_N, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) AS ROW_NUM FROM STATION) A
WHERE ROW_NUM = 
(SELECT (COUNT(*)+1)/2 FROM STATION)
;

SOLUTION 2) WORKS IN EVERY CASE

SELECT ROUND(AVG(D.Median_LAT_N),4) FROM 
(SELECT 
CASE 
WHEN COUNT(C.ROW_NUM) % 2 = 0 THEN 
(SELECT A.LAT_N FROM 
(SELECT LAT_N, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) AS ROW_NUM 
FROM STATION) A
WHERE A.ROW_NUM = (SELECT COUNT(*)/2 FROM STATION)
OR A.ROW_NUM = (SELECT (COUNT(*)/2) + 1 FROM STATION))
ELSE 
(SELECT B.LAT_N FROM 
(SELECT LAT_N, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) AS ROW_NUM 
FROM STATION) B
WHERE B.ROW_NUM = (SELECT (COUNT(*) + 1)/2 FROM STATION))
END AS Median_LAT_N
FROM 
(SELECT LAT_N, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) AS ROW_NUM 
FROM STATION) C) D;
