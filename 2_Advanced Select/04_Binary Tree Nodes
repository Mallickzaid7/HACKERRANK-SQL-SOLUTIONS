SOLUTION 1)

SELECT DISTINCT A.N,

WHEN A.N IN (SELECT B.P FROM BST B WHERE B.P IS NOT NULL) THEN "Inner"       ---HERE "WHERE B.P IS NOT NULL" is not required necessarily
ELSE "Leaf"
END AS SUII FROM BST A, BST B
ORDER BY A.N;

SOLUTION 2)

SELECT A.N, 
CASE WHEN A.P IS NULL THEN "Root"
WHEN A.N IN (SELECT B.P FROM BST B WHERE B.P IS NOT NULL) THEN "Inner"   ---HERE "WHERE B.P IS NOT NULL" is not required necessarily

ORDER BY A.N;


SOLUTION 3)

SELECT N, CASE WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root' 
WHEN(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BST WHERE P =A.N) > 0 THEN 'Inner'
ELSE 'Leaf'
END
FROM BST A
ORDER BY N;
